==========

Austin's lame attempt 

#Truth Table 
"https://github.com/Austinbolinger/ECE281_CE1/blob/master/TruthTable.JPG" 
The right version is in my lab not book
|A|B|C|
|-|-|-|
|0|0|1|

#Image
Here is the image of the testbench waveform

new link- for right output

#Analysis
The Truth table matched the image from the testbench.(*not really see below)



**C3C Hayden - explained to me the day of why we had different results. I did not, in my code, assign B_not to not B.**

So my D column on the truth table is also wrong which also means the F column is wrong
