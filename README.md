Austin's lame attempt 

#Truth Table 



#Image
Here is the image of the testbench waveform

#Analysis
The Truth table matched the image from the testbench.(*not really see below)

**C3C Hayden - explained to me the day of why we had different results. I did not, in my code, assign B_not to not B.**

So my D column on the truth table is also wrong
